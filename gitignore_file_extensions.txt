# .gitignore is a folder to be made where we can save certain extension (*.log,*.class) to 
# demand git to not add files with those extensions to the repository. 

# This way we will be able to save space on the repository.

# We can also add entire folders which git should not add to repo

# necessary files can be removed by making .gitignore files and adding the extension
